## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub

I'm a **Software Engineer** with **3 years of experience**, primarily focused on **backend development**. I also have a solid foundation in frontend technologies and a strong interest in scalable systems, high-performance applications, and event-driven architectures.

I hold a degree in **Systems Analysis and Development** from [Univates â€“ University of Vale do Taquari](https://www.univates.br/), and I'm passionate about continuous learning and building meaningful software.

I love working with **high-performance applications, scalable architectures, and event-driven systems**. My main focus is on **Golang** for backend development, but I'm always eager to explore new technologies.  
Recently, Iâ€™ve also been building **decentralized systems** and started studying and developing **Web3 applications**, exploring tools like **MetaMask**, **Ethereum**, and smart contract integration.
